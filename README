Superdumper
===========

This plugin consists of nothing but one rake-task,

rake db:superdumper

which outputs the file database.pdf in RAILS_ROOT. This pdf-file contains
your database scheme visualized, using graphviz. If you want to customise it, 
just modify it, the source isn't too hard to understand i guess.

Installing GraphVIZ
===================
Graphviz  http://www.graphviz.org/, is a graph visualization tool made by 
AT&T and Bell, and should be available for your platform using your package
manager. 

OS X:
=====
Using MacPorts, just do a 
# sudo port install graphviz
which should install everything necessary

Debian:
=======
# aptitude install graphviz
